## Overview

Accessible mammography datasets and innovative machine learning techniques are at the forefront of computer-aided breast cancer diagnosis. However, the opacity surrounding private datasets and the unclear methodology behind the selection of subset images from publicly available databases for model training and testing, coupled with the arbitrary incompleteness or inaccessibility of code, markedly intensifies the obstacles in replicating and validating the model's efficacy. These challenges, in turn, erect barriers for subsequent researchers striving to learn and advance this field. To address these limitations, we provide a pilot codebase covering the entire process from image preprocessing to model development and evaluation pipeline, utilizing the publicly available Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM) mass subset, including both full images and regions of interests (ROIs). We have identified that increasing the input size could improve the detection accuracy of malignant cases within each set of models. Collectively, our efforts hold promise in accelerating global software development for breast cancer diagnosis by leveraging our codebase and structure, while also integrating other advancements in the field.


Below conatins the overview of appling the CBIS-DDSM mass subset for breast cancer diagnosis:

## Dataset Availability
The data utilized in this study is downloaded from [here]( https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=22516629#2251662935562334b1e043a3a0512554ef512cad).

Full image size and the cropped area per 598 by 598 pixels are plotted as below:

## Methods
In general, our methods include: 1) converting DICOM to PNG format without altering bit depth, 2) mapping ROIs to corresponding full images to identify and crop abnormal areas while ensuring size congruence, 3) confirming sufficient crop size coverage for most abnormal regions, 4) appending cropped images to the preliminary target **598 Ã— 598** pixels with centered abnormal areas and removal of unwanted backgrounds, 5) performing data augmentation for enhanced diversity, 6) processing and splitting images into training, validation, and testing sets for model development, 7) optimizing computational efficient Xception network for model development, and 8) assessing effectiveness using multiple matrices and visualizations.

Steps to run the code we provided for model development:

1. Convert_DICOM_to_PNG.py
2. Map_ROI_to_Full_Images.py
3. Cropping.py
4. Remove_white_edges.py
5. Size_adjustment.py
6. Augmentation.py
7. pathology.py
8. model_development_and_evaluation.py (You will want to replace the "model_epoch_37.pth" with your best trained result)
9. OR, you could directly evaluate our model's performence with model_evaluation.py and our best saved check point "model_epoch_37.pth"

Steps to run the code for Figure 1B and 1C:
1. make sure you run the first 5 steps of the above lists
2. full_image_size&cropped_area.py
3. R_visualization.R

## Results
The model's performance evaluation is based on the checkpoint with the highest validation accuracy.

The best performed checkpoint can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18RxhTm9Oxak1dA0d2xihnHWekmEVug6h?usp=sharing)

Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and a confusion matrix are outlined in below:

## Example output
Our example outputs, including data processing, data visualization and model development and evaluation, are saved in folder example_output.

## Identified images with unwanted white edges
Identified cropped images with unwanted white backgrounds are stored in folder image_with_white_edge.

## Others
Other outputs that the authors think might be helpful can be found under folder Others, including the calculated full image size, percentage per 598 by 598 areas for corpped images, pathology info, identified mismatch info in sizewize between ROI and full images.
